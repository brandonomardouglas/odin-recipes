    <h2>Brief Description</h2>
    <p>Everyone makes tea differently – but if you popped round to our place for a visit, this is how we’d make you a brew.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Teabag</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Run the tap a little so the water’s nicely aerated, and only boil it once to keep the oxygen level up. Oxygen in water helps flavour!</li>
        <li>Pop a tea bag into your mug, pour over the hot water and stir briefly.</li>
        <li>Tea needs time to unlock all its flavour, so give it 4-5 minutes to do its thing. This is a perfect time to munch a sneaky biscuit or daydream about holidays.</li>
        <li>Before removing the tea bag, gently squidge it against the side of the mug. Just the once, mind – if you really mash it, it'll taste bitter.</li>
        <li>We like a splash of semi-skimmed or whole milk, but your brew is unique to you – so add milk, sugar, honey, lemon or nothing at all. Most importantly, enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
